/// SREG (Status control Register)
/// The status register contains information about the result of the most recently executed arithmetic instruction. This
/// information can be used for altering program flow in order to perform conditional operations. Note that the status register is
/// updated after all ALU operations, as specified in the instruction set reference. This will in many cases remove the need for
/// using the dedicated compare instructions, resulting in faster and more compact code.
/// The status register is not automatically stored when entering an interrupt routine and restored when returning from an
/// interrupt. This must be handled by software.

/// Toggling 8th bit to 0 or 1 can enable or disable interrupt respectively.
