/// Power management for ATmega328p chip using sleep modes.

/// Contains sleep modes.
///
/// Section 9.1 of ATmega328p datasheet.

/// ~ Idle: This  mode makes the MCU enter idle mode, stopping the CPU but
/// allowing the SPI, USART, analog comparator, ADC, 2-wire serial
/// interface, Timer/Counters, watchdog, and the interrupt system
/// to continue operating. This sleep mode basically halts clkCPU
/// and clkFLASH, while allowing the other clocks to run.

/// ~ ADCNR: ADC Noise Reducion mode makes the MCU enter ADC noise reduction
/// mode, stopping the CPU but allowing the ADC, the external interrupts,
/// the 2-wire serial interface address watch, Timer/Counter2, and the
/// watchdog to continue operating (if enabled). This sleep mode
/// basically halts clkI/O, clkCPU, and clkFLASH, while allowing the
/// other clocks to run.

/// ~ PowerDown: Power Down mode makes the MCU enter power-down mode. In this mode, the
/// external oscillator is stopped, while the external interrupts, the
/// 2-wire serial interface address watch, and the watchdog continue
/// operating (if enabled). Only an external reset, a watchdog system
/// reset, a watchdog interrupt, a brown-out reset, a 2-wire serial
/// interface address match, an external level interrupt on INT0 or INT1,
/// or a pin change interrupt can wake up the MCU. This sleep mode basically
/// halts all generated clocks, allowing operation of asynchronous modules only.

/// ~ PowerSave: Power Save mode is identical to Power Down, with one exception:
///
/// If Timer/Counter2 is enabled, it will keep running during sleep. The
/// device can wake up from either timer overflow or output  compare event
/// from Timer/Counter2 if the corresponding Timer/Counter2 interrupt enable
/// bits are set in TIMSK2, and the global interrupt enable bit in SREG is set.

/// ~ Standby: It is identical to Power Down, with one exception:
///
/// If Timer/Counter2 is enabled, it will keep running during sleep. The device
// can wake up from either timer overflow or output compare event from
/// Timer/Counter2 if the corresponding Timer/Counter2 interrupt enable bits
/// are set in TIMSK2, and the global interrupt enable bit in SREG is set.

/// ~ ExtStandby: Extendend Standby mode is identical to Power Save with the exception that
/// the oscillator is kept running. From extended standby mode, the device
/// wakes up in six clock cycles.

/// Disable: Disables the sleep mode.
