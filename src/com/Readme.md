# Introduction 

UART, or universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter, is one of the most used
device-to-device communication protocols.Embedded systems, microcontrollers, and
computers mostly use UART as a form of device-to-device hardware communication
protocol.
By definition, UART is a hardware communication protocol that uses asynchronous
serial communication with configurable speed and Data Format.

## Introduction to Serial and Asynchronous Communication

In Serial Communication, the data which is recieved in bytes is transmitted 
bit by bit in a sequenced manner, through the Bus or communication channel, and on
reaching the destination UART it is re assembled in bytes.

UART uses asynchronous communication for recieving data as it is not validated by a 
clock, or in other words, data is transmitted intermittently rather than in a steady
stream.In asynchronous transmission, data is sent one byte at a time and each byte is
preceded by start bit and stop bit.

To ensure the correct transmission the transmission and the reciever pins need to 
have same settings like Transmission Speed, Data length in bits, how is the Start and
Stop bit. To understand UART in more Detail click [here](https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/uart-a-hardware-communication-protocol.html#) to access online resources.
